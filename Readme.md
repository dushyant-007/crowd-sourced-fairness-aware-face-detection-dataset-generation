# Crowd-Sourced Fairness-aware Face detection dataset generation

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a face detection dataset that is fair and unbiased in terms of age, gender, and race. The aim is to develop a face detection model that can accurately detect and differentiate between faces from different demographic groups with equal accuracy.

### Definition of Fairness

By fairness, we mean that the face detection model should exhibit consistent accuracy across various demographic groups. In other words, the accuracy for detecting faces of individuals with black skin should be comparable to the accuracy for individuals with brown skin, Asian skin, or white skin.

## Inspiration and Background

This project is motivated by discussions surrounding the responsible use of AI. Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning acknowledge that the fairness of machine learning models depends on the quality and bias within the training data. The data collection and labeling process play a crucial role in determining the biases present in the resulting algorithms.

Several approaches have been proposed to address the fairness problem, including the use of generative examples to mitigate race-related features, augmenting the dataset with underrepresented group images, and modifying the loss function to consider accuracies across different demographic groups. However, these methods only partially solve the issue, as the underlying training data remains inherently biased.

## Proposed Solution: Creating an Equitable Dataset

To achieve true fairness and overcome biased training data, the project aims to create a dataset that accurately represents all sections of society in equal proportions. This solution requires a comprehensive collection of data that is representative of diverse age groups, genders, and races.

### Leveraging Crowdsourcing Platforms

To accomplish this task, we are exploring the use of crowdsourcing platforms as a means of collecting highly accurate data. Specifically, we plan to utilize Amazon Mechanical Turk to generate accurate labels for our dataset. By leveraging the power of crowdsourcing, we can involve a larger pool of contributors and obtain a more comprehensive and diverse dataset.

## Future Considerations

Through this project, we will evaluate the effectiveness of crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, in gathering data with a high level of accuracy. Additionally, we will analyze the implications of utilizing such platforms for building fair and responsible AI systems. This research will contribute to advancing the state of responsible AI and shed light on how progress can be made using crowd-sourcing platforms.
